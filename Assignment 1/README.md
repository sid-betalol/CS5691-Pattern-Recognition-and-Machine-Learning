Score: 49/50

**Implementations:**
1. Binary Bayes Classfiers learned from data using Maximum Likelihood Estimators for three cases:
   - Same known covariance for both the labels
   - Same unknown covariance for both the labels
   - Different unknown covariance values for the 2 labels
2. Multiclass Bayes Classifiers learned from data using Maximum Likelihood Estimation with a loss matrix
3. Bias-variance analysis for regularized regression
4. Underfitting-overfitiing analysis for regularized regression
5. Bayesian Regression

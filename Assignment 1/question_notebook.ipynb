    "2. You are not allowed to insert new cells in the submitted notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. The code is to be written in Python 3.6+ syntax. Latest versions of other packages maybe assumed.\n",

    "5. In CodeWrite Cells, the only outputs to be given are plots asked in the question. Nothing else to be output/print. \n",

    "6. If TextWrite cells ask you to give accuracy/error/other numbers you can print them on the code cells, but remove the print statements before submitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "10. All plots must be labelled properly, all tables must have rows and columns named properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Plotting the data and prediction is highly encouraged for debugging. But remove debugging/understanding code before submitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Before subbmission ensure that you submit with the outputs (do not clear the outputs), so that when evaluating we can run selectively.\n",

    "    2. Python cells with setup code for further evaluations. (DO NOT TOUCH THESE CELLS) (**Cell type: CodeRead**)\n",

    "4. The code is to be written in Python 3.6 syntax. Latest versions of other packages maybe assumed.\n",

    "5. In CodeWrite Cells, the only outputs to be given are plots asked in the question. Nothing else to be output/print. \n",

    "8. All code must be written by yourself. Copying from other students/material on the web is strictly prohibited. Any violations will result in zero marks.\n",

    "9. All datasets will be given as .npz files, and will contain data in 4 numpy arrays :\"X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test\". In that order. The meaning of the 4 arrays can be easily inferred from their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. All plots must be labelled properly, all tables must have rows and columns named properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Before subbmission ensure that you submit with the outputs (do not clear the outputs), so that when evaluating we can run selectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Before submission ensure that the path for the folder containing the data is \"../../Data/\" \n"
